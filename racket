# i love racket community
##or how im doing so far

###1. start small
I started my master in economics by trying to make replica of schelling's
segregation model. At that time there was this boy (mostly a programmer)
teaching me racket. He cried over my code and because that was the time of
my exam session, he had no choice but wrote me the version 0 of the model
so that i could let go of the obsession and go back to my exams.
(*Remember how many times you invented smt great over the break time between semesters?*).

I watched the population toy moving around red and blue and arranging itself into
clusters. The clusters cant grow too big because the same force that accumulates
the cluster at one end will make it fall apart at the other end. Then i went back
to studying.

**hindsight note**: till date, there is no cure for obsession

###2. iterate n times
The next semester, the code comes back to me in a bigger exercise: make replica of
a recent paper. I'd summarise it here:

I need to generate a population of machines playing a repeated game, say,
prisoner's dilemma. They get payoff and the stronger grows big over time at
the expense of poor doers. These machines are conditional with memory 1.
So they remember the previous round and make the next move based on that.

People relentlessly read my versions despite the marginal value of reading me
drops to zero. I'm forever grateful for that and for their huge amount of effort
and intellectual spending on me and for me. Others who can't care, i deeply understand.

**quote**: "you really are the average of people you spend time the most with.
so sit at the feet of leading practitioners in your industry
and work your ass off".

**lesson**: young and pompous are not offending. lazy and pretentious in front of a
formidable person (who is surely hard-working) is offending

###3. fail fast, fail often, all with your best deed

even when my thesis was still a naive and very premature one, i started to send it
to events. just to fail. ("rejection is not failure" anyway - pg).
but after each submission, i see the naive details and can
rewrite it better.
i never dare to read their comments (if they do comment)
when i get rejected, though. i'm kinda coward.
i just take the no and move on. dont take the why, jessica
livingston said so.

there is this summer school in rostock that insists on phd students *with experience*
so i wait after i got accepted into a phd to apply :)
the phd result was out online just a few days before the deadline.
the supervisor was very kind to write a paragraph supporting me (they require supervisor
to say something).
and i submit with the application my thesis to increase the chance of getting accepted
in the course.

I didnt even think that i'd get accepted, i really didnt plan to buy flight ticket to
be back in trento before november. But there it is.
people in rostock are so nice they pay me to come, to stay and say that i can
join the small workshop at the end also.

then a small meeting in lisbon says i can join them also.
that's absolutely too good to be true for me
but Im not sure yet. they cant pay me so i'd try to see if i can.
I never want to lose a chance to talk to
people who would like to listen to what i do.

**lesson**: relentlessly iterate. however, avoid burn-out by doing small achievement
between big failure.

**lesson**: usually when they dont want to accept, they need to generate
some reasonable reasons, but sometimes these reasons dont matter. "take the no, dont
take the why" (jessica livingston).

###4. because rejection is not failure, acceptance is not the end
though not healthy, *fear-driven* effort is quite
a brutally strong force :D.
when i search for my
coursemates on google i kinda freak out. They really are *phd with experience*.

I imagine when everybody'd open their github and mathematica ...then they'd see my
github as an offense to the simulation society. So im working to make an (other)
iteration. I officially make the agents to be finite state automata.

###5. why the internet matters
I search google and find a very good way to structure data, in this
[blog](http://timthornton.net/blog/id/538fa6f2f09a16ba0674813d)
by tim thornton, he's so nice he answers fully to my questions, suggest incredible idea
and will up part 2 soon.

I started a
[thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/racket-users/4o1goSwrLHA)
on racket mailing list and went on irc #racket also (IRC chat log
[here](http://pastebin.com/sxrCnwRV)). Everybody
works on mailing list and IRC. That's where working people come and share and work
together. If you understand
[this message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe1TZaElTAs),
you understand the internet.

Why irc is so efficient? Because it's so simple.  It's a network since the beginning
of the internet, before yahoo itself. you choose a nickname, choose a channel
(#racket) You ask your question,
and somewhere around the world, some guy who is going to have lunch will opt in and
answer you right before he goes. The global network with full range of expertise just
never sleeps. I felt like i was in a room with experts on different domains
that bring their own experience, and cultivated intuition from their matured project.
each informative comment comes and illuminates different aspects
of the big problem.

**lesson**: the competitive edge of something is in its social capital.

I code a version 0 here [on github](https://github.com/ayaderaghul/sample-fsm).
