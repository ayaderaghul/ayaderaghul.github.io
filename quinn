#harley quinn

to me, a day that your immune system and your code betray you is the day you have excuse
to binge surf the internet =.=



People are freaking out over how they'll portray Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad. So
let's talk Harley Quinn.

##tl;dr summary
Harley Q's essence is not a pure genius. At best,  Joker's compliment is
that "she might even
[derserve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35XK-0AB2jc&list=LLPcV7wAnTzTaq9392rV6eLg&index=20)
me". And that's a real compliment. *(To Deadshot,
he said "apart from Batman, you are the one who causes me most pain in the ass")*.
Mostly because harley quinn is not a matured character, she is at the point
between being naive insane and enormous potential to level joker.

##moral alert

DC story is very amoral.
if you want superhero, you go watch
Marvel. In DC, you'll fall for
villains. not normal villains, but super villains (aka "men that just wanna watch
the world burn").
Even Superman will soon be taken down by DC as the bloody false god.
the only *righteous* guy (batman) gets all the blame, poor him =))
Batman is the least cool character in arkham assault, even a tough evil government officer
can look down on his warning and smirk: "what? what you gonna do abt my business?
start a blog?" *(I laugh so hard at that line)*.

##Harley story
the [origin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd_Puz9ngRE)
of harley quinn described everything.
dr harleen quinzel interned at arkharm asylum. she was young, smart, ambitious.
she likes *extreme personality*. and joker immediately smells that.
he manipulates the girl falling deadly in love with him to use her.

of course it works.

for harleen quinzel, joker is some kid who just want to make joke and laugh and be happy.
along joker childhood is the brutal rejection of his abusive father and joker forever
seeks the affirmation for his little jokes since then. well, at least that's the vision
joker plants in quinzel head.
then there is this batman - equally psychological
[traumatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmA0WQdM6h4)
childhood kid, striving to be
the righteous of the world. this batman always shut down joker's joke and that doesnt
make joker happy. what doesnt make joker happy, doesnt make quinzel happy.

the tipping point is when joker escape arkham asylum for some fun at weekend, and
batman beat the shit out of him, bringing him back, drop him near death in front of
quinzel.

quinzel gone mad and official launch her alter ego. her accent radically changes into
a little girl voice and she dress like

(the clown in old tradditional
art). she calls herself harley quinn. (first time they met, joker said that name
puts a smile on his face.)
she rescues joker and thought they could live a forever after happy ending.

that just starts a period of her life getting abused by joker. because after all, joker
manipulate her just to use her. but that poor girl is madly deeply
in love with her psychopath puddin'. they say abused hapless women cant let go.

then joker starts to have genuine moment of affection toward harley quinn here and
there. but after all, psychopath doesnt
understand love, and this dude is the ultimate psychopath.
so the poisonous relationship goes on.

##2 cents
all these times, harley quinn is a young immatured character. she doesnt show any
complex aspects. shooting sex toy. batshit crazy. deadly. but still
seemingly hollow and shallow. and hapless.

events let her stay away from joker, and she gains some perspective. just some.
who underestimate
what joker plants is surely not paying attention to the movie.
with some perspective,
she gets more matured and in arkham asylum she pushes her character to a whole new level.
a level that has the potential to fare joker well. (joker himself says "she might even
deserve me"). that makes her extremely dangerous. this is a big might-be though,
joker is above all other's villains league, he's far off in a class of himself.

apart from the weak point of
being among the toy stuffs of joker, harley quinn is still
a formidable supervillain on her own, compared to others.
the suicide squad starts off to break in arkham asylum, everybody (and they are all
supervillains) freaks out. and with their sane
reason, they question the task. but once Killer Frost heard that harley is
complaining childishly about joker: "we already break up. never mind that",
Killer Frost immediately said "well, i'm convinced".

=)))

that is to say how legitimately insane you are entitled when you are joker sidekick.

so, the essence of harley quinn character is not a pure genius, but a complex abused
history. dont underestimate that. she is the wild card that i hope DC can handle well.

back to the film, after nicholson

over new joker's drugged emo-teen pic ;) i
dont raise expectation on harley quinn but it's worth waiting anyway.
the actress they cast, she looks more like sexy barbie so they tend to
portray her skew to that side i think. because that's really what harley quinn was
in her early stage of being heavily manipulated and abused.
also, movie is movie. their audience tends to have different perspective of *sexy*.
they put too much violence and sex and nudity in game of thrones, doesnt
make any more sense, only make it more appealing to their weird audience.

i keep my wait for a harley quinn that is less physically provocative, but still
mega intellectually hot.
