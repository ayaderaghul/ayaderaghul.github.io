#subject: advanced class

i rarely look back. mostly because when i look back, there'd be random awkward moments
sizzling up to cring attack me. so i'd better leave the whole set of events
alone and discard
the whole memory when it dues.

but i talked to an undergrad at mensa today. about meaningful things. he runs simulation
on bargaining game in python. i'd love to document what we say while eating, but it's
maybe for another post, because it's about another topic i'd like to touch when
it's completely finished.

suddenly after he left, i think about my bachelor degree: advanced class. what
does it mean *advanced*. our classrooms are built to look just like US class, we got
US professors, we study in English.. this program belongs to Ministry policy so we got
subsidised tuition fee (still high, though).. and we are fed that spirit everyday.

there is a similar program (our university is very good at creating differentiation
program and segment customers very well to charge at different price)
but they dont belong to
Ministry national policy so they pay a hefty load of money. we heard students
of that program: if one day their classroom is dirty, they dont step in to study.
because they pay a lot of money, they are very strict on how it should be spent.

so what do we get from being in an *advanced* class?
today i realise that, for every single of us, we got a stamp of
asshole certificate on our forehead, for free, for everywhere we go.
we are not even aware of it. which means there'll be
a time lag after we left our golden nest that we hold on to that *label*,
and there'll be a self denial period following.

##.
note: i have nothing to do with asshole attitude, i never mind winners with attitude,
in case i must spit out a problem,
i think i list problem with losers having attitude first.
why i dont have problem with attitude in general? because there is always a safe zone
from the destructive force of the attitude if you stay far enough -> i can always
choose to keep far from ppl that dont matter
