#who am i

a student in Economics in Trento University, Italy

#what do i do
it's needless to elaborate on how much there are for us to see
constrainted to how short we live, how limited we are and how fast things go by
if we just stand·by to let them go by.

hence, as any typical grad kids, i:

- do exercises, do some writing (mostly on game theory)

- program some toy software to solve daily problems (in Racket/Scheme)

- sketch graphic inspired by things seen online

- surf internet to read cool stuff produced by cool people

#what do i produce
