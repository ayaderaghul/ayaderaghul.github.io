# my talk at workshop "the science of choice" - max planck institute

i owe a great great deal to all people (and there are a big number
of people) that make this happen. please note that i choose to share
this in the hope that it'd be useful, so be kind. else, please contact me first
and foremost to resolve any conflicts.

this talk initiates from my master thesis so it's a sort of ongoing work.
i present this work of different versions at:

- workshop "the science of choice" - max planck institute, rostock

- [meetings of game theory application](https://sites.google.com/site/gametheorymeetings/home) - lisbon 2015

- special track on evolutionary game theory - new york (upcoming, Dec 15)

the version i upload here is recorded at rostock and i really like the atmostphere there.
it's a pity they cut off the audience Q&A, otherwise you'd be amazed at how smart
are the colleagues from UK, Rostock, Berlin.. some of them are like really young.

i extremely appreciate all the discussion and the colleagues i've met in these events.
if i start to describe them, it'd take another blog post. and it'd be too long.
life is too short and there are too many people in this world, we can only be *locally
human*. (at a grander scale, faces become statistics.)

please do consider kindness before you react.
