# the science of choice

a big thank to all people that make this happen. 

this talk initiates from my master thesis so it's a sort of amateur work.
i present this work of different versions at:

- workshop "the science of choice" - max planck institute, rostock Oct 15

- [meetings](https://sites.google.com/site/gametheorymeetings/home) of game theory application - lisbon Nov 15

- special track on evolutionary game theory - new york (upcoming, Dec 15)

the version i upload here is recorded at rostock. 
it's a pity they cut off the audience Q&A, otherwise you'd be amazed at how smart
they are. some of them are really young.

i still take Q&A. please do consider kindness before you react negatively.
