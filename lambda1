#lambda calculus, infinite regress & rational expectation

*(obsessive compulsive important revision of part 3 : 12/1/2015)*

recently i got haunted by this little thing called *lambda calculus*.
it's truly a wonder because it starts so simple and lovely but it doesnt even
need to grow complicated in order to shock & awe you. it shocks and awes you
because it elaborate wildly complex while the core stays seriously humble.

i write this obsession in my head down with some reference to economics,
even if it is much more poorly written than
the crystally lucid explanation in the
[book](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/slpj-book-1987/)
i read, because i hope it will get rid of me and haunt you readers instead (if you
havent had contact with it before :D)

the structure of this note has 3 parts:
- lambda calculus introduction
- lambda calculus *solves* the infinite regress
- rational expectation, then what?

## expression 
before we categories lambda calculus into tags like *computer science*,
*scarry mathematics*, i would like to approach it like a layperson, a kid with no
assumption or any premise at all.

hence i will construct this lambda calculus as i construct a language step by step.
this language is to write down the world in symbols. and it has tools (logic)
to manipulate symbols it writes down also (like in mathematics language).

what does a language need? first and foremost, verb, then comes the noun.
to do what? to express an expression.

##function
lambda calculus treats function (the verb) as fundamental & first-class unit, both
syntactically and ideally speaking. why i say syntactically? you may ask:

- how to build a language that *syntactically* treats
function as a central object of interest?

- simple. to do that, we can at least mimic the syntax of functions.
here the word function refers as loosely as it can to the elementary
mathematics unit or to the action that we carry out as a process.

example:

>(do laundry)

>(wash 10-clothes)

>(+ 1 2)

>(+ (- 4 5) (* 2 1))

(+ 1 2) is an expression, just like the expression "do laundry".
you may notice its structure, it starts with a verb, followed by objects (nouns) that
will be put under the action of the verb.

in a generic notation, we write
> f x

it looks like function. and lambda calculus uses that grammar syntax,
so it looks like it treats function. then:

- how to know that lambda calculus *truly is* a treatment of
abstract function we want?

- this is to be answered later.

##lambda abstraction
there are different types of expression, a constant or a variable can be an expression.
but the biggest interest is in an expression that *works* - a verb, a function.
they are called lambda abstraction.

this is lambda abstraction grammar syntax:

> (λ x . + 1 x)

> λ is a special note

> x is the variable

> . is the signal that we start the body of the expression

> () signals the open & end of an expression

now if we want to know f(x) at x=3, we write:
> f 3

> = (λ x . + 1 x) 3

how do we apply the lambda abstraction to the argument 3?

> we write down the body of the expression + 1 x

> we replace the varible x with the argument 3

> -> + 1 3 = 4

function can be argument, too.

> (λf.f 3) (λx. + 1 x)

how do we process this expression? we execute them *leftmost outermost*.
we see that the lambda abstraction (λf.f 3) is the function
and (λx. + 1 x) is the argument.

> so we write down the body of the function: f 3

> and we replace the variable f with the argument (λx. + 1 x)

> -> (λx. + 1 x) 3

> write down the body of the function + 1 x

> replace variable x with argument 3

> -> + 1 3 = 4

we can denote capital letter to be a function, like F = (λx. - x 1)
(in maths: f(x) = x - 1)

here we are done with grammar syntax of lambda language,
we even show some calculation, the ability to do calculation
makes the name *lambda calculus*.

##recursion

from the lambda grammar above, do you think that a lambda abstraction can be
capable of describing recursion?

i would like to take an economics example.

consider the game beauty contest. there is a crowd. each one gives a number.
if that number = 1/2 * average -> the person wins.

the recursive nature of this calculation is:

> take the average number as 50 or whatever (not relevant here)

> if 50 is the average, your best response should be taking half of that 1/2 * 50

> but the best response for the above action is to take half 1/2 \* 1/2 * 50

> ..

so the recursive function of best response looks like:

> BR = (λx. BR (* .5 x))

we can't do this. in order to do this, we need to be able to name a function
and refer to *that* function inside its body. lambda calculus doesnt allow this.
because lambda abstraction is an *anonymous* function.

for example: if you see me but never knows my name, you cannot refer to me later on.

we continue to simplify the above recursive function we desire:

> BR = λx. (...BR...)

this is equivalent to:

> BR = (λbr.λx. (...br...)) BR

we separate the BR as an argument to a normal lambda abstraction (λbr.λx. (...br...)).
we call this function H = (λbr.λx. (...br...))

> -> BR = H BR

this equation is like the mathematical equation:

x = x*x

now if we can solve the equation BR = H BR, the solution is BR.
BR is the fixpoint of the function H, just like we need to solve for the fixpoints
of the function f=x*x (which is 0 & 1 i think)

now we assume we got a function Y that inputs another function and
return (another) function which the fixpoint of that input function.
we call Y a fixpoint combinator.

> by definition, Y H = BR

the convenience of Y is that we can define BR = Y H which is a non recursive function.

to check if Y H works like BR:

> this is H = (λbr.λx. br (* .5 x))

> we try BR 100

>= Y H 100

>= H (Y H) 100

>= (λbr.λx. br (* .5 x)) (Y H) 100

>= (λx. Y H (* .5 x)) 100

>= Y H (* .5 100)

>= Y H 50

>= H (Y H) 50

>= ....


this is a best response function that continually takes half of the previous best response.
so if we got this Y combinator, we are done. lambda abstraction can speak recursive itself.

before go to Y, we finish this game first. the result is

> (1/2)^∞ * 50 = 0

we can say the fixpoint of the function .5x is 0.
this calculation will loop infinitely even at x=0.
in general, we need to tell when to terminate, for example, when x reaches 0.

but if you are in the game, would you really choose 0 in the first try?
if not, what is the value of the prediction 0?
what is the relevance of the theory that predict 0?

anyway, continue with the Y combinator.
you may ask, if we have to borrow Y combinator from another language to make lambda
language capable of exhibiting recursion, is it in vain?
not, the miracle is that Y can be written as a lambda abstraction also!
this is it:

> Y = (λh. (λx. h (x x))  (λx. h (x x)))

we check to see if Y really have that property:

>Y H

>= (λh. (λx. h (x x))  (λx. h (x x))) H

>= (λx. H (x x))  (λx. H (x x))
(the first term is the function, the second is the argument)

>= H ( (λx. H (x x)) (λx. H (x x)) )
(inside the parenstheses is the (Y H) that we write in the second equality)

>= H (Y H)


# rational expectation, then what? 

this sounds very profound in a mathematical sense so i was searching to find
this concept in economics.

i was horrified. i found it this way.

in a game of incomplete information, common knowledge is not all knowledge we have,
each player may have private information about his type
(for example: i can be forever selfish, or i can be
a reciprocator). and you dont know which type i am, but you know that if i am selfish
you should act selfish, but if i am a reciprocator, you will act generous because
i will reciprocate your action and both will be better off.

now solving this game is tricky. you have to form expectation (belief) about my type.
but you know that i'll do the same to decide what i should do.
so you also need to speculate
on my expectation about your type. then you need to form expectation on my expectation on
your expectation of my type... this argument can be looped forever.

I define my expectation function like this, Harsanyi calls this infinite regress.

>EXP = λx. (...EXP...)

we rewrite this definition:

>EXP = (λexp.λx. (...exp...)) EXP

this is the paradox we see above, and we know that
we got a paradox machine to bear the collapse of it: Y-combinator.
we know that there are some fixed expectation function of the system.
and there can be more than one solution but Y-combinator returns the least fixpoint.

note that this finding is striking for compiler's application:
it makes possible to define a recursive function
(expectation function in this case), however,
it doesnt return the fixpoint of the function.
for example, in the best response function above,
the program reaches a fixpoint and keeps looping infinitely
-> we have to specifically tell it when to terminate.

we may tell it to return the value that it loops for n=100 times already
maybe, and we got the solution of the game. the thing is,
the game may have more than 1 fixpoint and depend on where the function starts, it may get stuck in a local fixpoint.
anyway, you see that lambda calculus *almost* solves the infinite regress.


if i'm not wrong, the fixpoint of the function is what economists call the *rational expectation*, the quest for standard equilibrium. they believe that if government can trigger a rational prediction for the crowd, the crowd can start to roll toward an quilibrium which is perfect (full employment
for example). i think "recursive macroeconomics" etc is about this. and i think they cross the line.

for me, the profound Y-combinator in maths is not nonsense in economics. consider the beauty contest again.

you may not choose 0 for the first try. but if this result is publicly taught to you,
or the game is played repeatedly & you figure it out yourself, what will be the tendency
of your number? your number will decrease, just like any others. will the result reach 0
as predicted? yes, why not?

Simon once wrote paper about: if the poll vote is public, would it drives crowd vote
in a predicted way? yes. but Simon doesnt cross the line.

but if you base on the fixpoint of the infinite regress of expectation function:

> EXP = λx. (...EXP...)

to claim that government policy can manipulate expectation of a complex social system,
so that if they all conform, the crowd will be set on a roll toward *a fantastic equilibrium*???

first, this sounds fictional. you can see that if the game has only 2-3 persons
this sounds good. but if the number of players increases one or two more persons, it starts getting complicated.
and the society is vast, its behavior is so complex that no one can cover the whole sky with his bare hand.

if in programming, we have functions that are self reference, in economics game,
two players make up a mutually referential expectation function, and if we have
more than 2, they make up a collectively referential expectation function.

for example:

>with 2 players: my best response BR1(x) = 2x + 2

>assume that you face the same situation, your BR2(y)= 2y + 2 also.

>in equilibrium: i choose x=a, you choose y=b

> by definition of an equilibrium:

> BR1(b) = a

> BR2(a)=b

>which means: BR1(BR2(a)) = a (all expectation comes true)

> let f(z) = BR1(BR2(z)) = 2(2x + 2) + 2

and this is the case of only two persons. if we got 3 persons in the society:

> BR1(BR2(a,c), BR3(a,b)) = BR1(b,c) = a

>..

the complication will increase exponentially. and people change
second from second. that's why i think that
solving this is fictional.

second, if one insists on this fiction intentionally,
it sounds like monopoly of faith, love & truth to me.

monopoly of oil? im not sure good or bad,

but i dont believe in especially
monopoly of faith, love & truth.
