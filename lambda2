#functional language, & the nature of copyright

sometimes i wonder whether i just sucks at managing *the nerve tick* of [dopamine craving](https://medium.com/neuroscience-internet/how-the-internet-dopamine-and-your-brain-are-working-together-to-screw-your-potential-1ac176538961)
as a mature adult or i simply crossed the threshold of being statistically normal
into obsessive compulsive.

i use *the nerve tick* to describe
the increasingly irritating *tick* (like a clock ticking
inside my head) of a group of neurons demanding my attention
toward a specific topic they are vibrantly discussing on, while i'm miserably trying
to ignore their request to dictate my scarce-resourced brain on reading things that
supposedly matter more at the present
(like exam stuff).

but you dont argue with your physiology program right?
when im hungry, words putting before my eyes
turn into squiggly symbols and
not of my slightest interest any more.

same as when i dont see any drops of dopamine on materials i read anymore.

-> other grad kids must either love all their subjects or able to manage
boredom like a ninja.

(you see? the perk of being a lazy student is that she develops sophisticated rationale
to justify the failure of her exams - a brilliantly useful defense mechanism.)

## left·over question

from the previous post, we were saying that lambda calculus
speaks in term of functions, syntactically and ideally.

- how do we build a language that *syntactically* treats
function as its first·class citizen?
 - we mimic the syntax of the function so it looks like we
speak functions -> if we are reading the syntax, we are reading
its *operational semantics*.

- when we speak lambda calculus, how do we know that
we are *truly* expressing idea of abstract functions?
 -  we are able to give the syntactical expression a
 *denotational semantics*.

## denotational semantics
the ability to read *denotational semantics* is the ability to read
between the line. for example my modern native language uses latin
alphabet & its pronunciation. hence i can read (pronounce) italian
words quite well without understanding a single thing.
like a kid learning the face of letters & symbols for the first time.
kid can read symbols out loud for days before kid slowly makes sense out of
those squiggles.

so it happens that there are kids who cant even remember the squiggles 1+1=2 at all,
and there are kids who successfully recreate a bunch of squiggles without
understand what they denote, and there are kids who can comprehend the thing
in vision but fail to abide rules of conventional squiggles..

-> put it simple, there are two things we need to separate here: symbol & value.
we live in a [universe that makes it possible to write down information (value)
in symbols](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVXQUItNEDQ). so we got writing as a tool to archive, transport & refer to
information for the sake of accumulating it. the thing is, value doesnt
materially exist, and vision inside an artist's mind may be vibrant & lovely
but it desperately stays a vision. without the equipment to read mind directly,
they have to write down their beautiful, vivid & agonizing vision
in languages (maths language, music language, painting language..).
they have to express their idea into symbols.

fail to separate this concern, and we got thing like copyright law.

## the soul is inherently copyrighted

**consider this story** in vietnamese fairy tale, one man plays chess so geniusly
that the chess god descends from heaven to play with him. of course the
man loses but the chess god leaves him some incense. the chess god says:
if the man is in trouble, the man burns the incense
& the chess god will descend again to help him.

after a time, the man dies a sudden die. the wife cleans the house & sees
some incense, she lights them on the husband altar to mourn him. the chess god descends
but it's too late. the man's corspe has rotten. so the chess god says:
recently in this village, there is a butcher who just died so the corpse
is new, i will call back the soul of your husband into that corpse.

the wife rushes to the butcher's house & says he's her dear husband.
the husband confirms but the
sorrow family doesnt believe that. they all go to legal court.

-> the question is: how should the court decide?

if we believe that the soul is separated from the body, that husband *is*
the chess grandmaster. and the court in the story (the collective mind
of vietnamese folklore tellers) agrees with that.

i think he is neither the butcher nor the pure chess grandmaster anymore. the consciousness
of the chess grandmaster (if can be recalled from death), now roots in a new
body with different physical structure. the soul is the [mental representation](http://www.technologyreview.com/qa/528151/the-importance-of-feelings/)
of the physical aspect of the body in awareness of environment context.
hence different physical structure may give rise to some new features
of the chess master's mind.

-> the butcher wife surely cant
copyright her husband corpse. the man may claim him as the chess master
but
if over time, the chess master's wife
cant keep up with *him* having quite new features upgraded,
they may break up also.


**another situation** is when you compare me in the past and me now.
i'm surely not that person
in the past, she is obviously not me.
she faces struggles that physically changes to refresh her
brain & body cells (maybe her gene expression also) everyday
& **among all the possibilities that she can evolve
to be, I am the one that survives & emerges**.
i *could have been* so much different
among the infinite possibilities available.

but the thing is, she once exists. no one can deny that. what she
struggles to get & to produce, she surely gets credits for that.
if copyright is about copyrighting symbols, she - me in the past - has never
been existed, got no credits at all. why? because not a single atom (or wave)
in that person truly remains (together) today. isnt it magnificient, to realise that
[waves & atoms spontaneously come together to become you in each moment?](http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_our_queer_universe?language=en)

but no one ever can erase that me in the past.
because value is inherently copyrighted.

**consider another case**, i clone myself into another little Chi.
we share a life UNTIL that moment. but FROM that moment on, she is not me
and im not her. things may be complicated for others but we will go
different ways of development from that moment on. if you advocate copyrighting
symbols, can you say who deserve to be killed? does the clone violate
copyright law? no.

##what is the meaning of copyrighting symbols?

the artists & painters understand this concept the most. 
no matter how perfect you can replicate an original painter of Van Gogh,
you are never Van Gogh, & your replica never becomes anything respected
(it has no value at all).

i may try to make **another example** closer to commercial product,
[from here](http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/lawpoli/colour/2004061001.php)
and [here](http://www.gwern.net/Copyright).

let's say i code a program
that randomly generate all kinds of symbols, the symbols are all random
and maybe repeated (like in a Babel book).

now, i write an algorithm to extract a subset of symbols out of that
program. truly coincidental, i got a version of Hamlet in vietnamese.
now what do you think? does that *Hamlet* belong to me? or does that
algorithm make me Shakespeare?

sorry, it's obviously f*cking not.

shakepeare value is his value. english symbols may hold that value.
vietnamese symbols may hold that value.
german symbols may hold that value.
but the symbols are *not* the value. only the value can be the value itself.

but you cant say the program or the algorithm violate copyright.
the program generates random stuff. the algorithm do job of interpreting,
it could produce some rubbish writing instead, who knows?

**still** think im tricking you? read [this comic](http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=353).
think about softwares like stata, or windows.
these things are all binary numbers (0 1 0 1 0...).
they *copyright* these chunks.
now i got harmless chunks of 0s & 1s
which is completely different from the chunk of
0s & 1s in these products you buy. then i write algorithm to read my
chunks in different ways. how far can i go?
the algorithm may read my chunks & return something like half of stata,
is it illegal yet? can you really
draw a fine line of violating?

if not, maybe there is no violation at all.

-> the only point of coypright is for economic purpose.
producing these stuff costs quite a lot resources in the old time.
so distributors & middlemen need to get some sure cash because
they pay authors & they bear the risk of the product failure.

but we are now in the internet era, so this reason to protect the
profit of distributors & ancient middlemen doesnt really hold anymore.

the thing is, creators & inventors that i know are very open·minded
& they themselves promote these principles.
it doesnt do any harm to give [firm credits to authors](https://creativecommons.org/) & at the same time
[give freedom & openness for users](http://www.gwern.net/Evolutionary%20Licenses).

and free open·source solution is claiming a big share of profit in technology market.
a vast set of free softwares that illiterate users like me
are using everyday is just *by·product* of
the free open·source ecosystem.
users have enough [Freedom 0](http://web.archive.org/web/20110726084909/http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
to live a decent life.
(if you get geeky, then you need freedom 1 & [open source principle](http://web.archive.org/web/20110726025448/http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php) &
they are also available).

###note
from denotational semantics to copyright is quite off·topic, but if you
truly understand the separated nature of symbol & value, you get the essential
base of functional programing.

also, for me, it makes my life easier.
