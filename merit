recently, i start to feel i need to fix my attitude. being the marginalised for the whole
time until now, i'd like to be accepted. so i decide to invest a part of my precious
energy in intentionally socialising. my resource is limited in almost everything so
i cant spend too much in fancy things like socialising. but i decide to invest a bit
more. when i say this, i come across this reaction that says everyone has problem, you
cant just use that as excuses. yes everyone is poor, everyone complains that they are
poor, i'd say that they dont know what poor means. poverty runs in my family like
tradition, it has written in our cultural gene undeniable traits of "being unfamiliar
with service and formality" [d h lawrence]. it's the same for my annoying behavior in
eating habit and living habit, you dont know my problem, if you are born into privilege,
resist the urge to project your first world problem on me.

(i wonder where does d h lawrence get all those words from. his storylines are abnormal,
i'd say i like o henry's lighthearted spirit better, but d h lawrence's words are
like angel's [i only read short stories].)

turns out that i wasnt wrong after all. though investing energy in cultivating social
acquantaince does help, its marginal value is too tiny compared to other tasks i can do.
in the end, like in some ted talk, if you have a very annoying trait or unconventional
characteristic (for example: you are ugly), it's less trouble because who fancy you
will fancy you anyway. in the other case, if you are beautiful to everyone, it may end
up that no one cares to approach you because they think it's competitive. my boss said
"if you are ugly, then you dont have to worry, because when someone loves you, it's true.
also, if you are poor, then work hard and study."
