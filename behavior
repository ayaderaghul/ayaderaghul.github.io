#theoretical & empirical: on the tension between game theory & behavioral economics in me

i was complaining about my academic grades (a lot).
not sure why i got good stuff in theoretical area & do very very bad
in empirical. it's like i'm missing something obvious, something that i
desparately think it is but it stubbornly isnt.

and it becomes a serious concern.

suddenly i remember that two people that i see as very narcissim
(however the word spells)
are the ones that my colleague sees as no big deal.
and people who he is strongly annoyed of their egos are the ones
i comment as funny, witty & cute.

that's it!! there must be something really really wrong with our mind.
all this sh*t is actually in our head, & that's enough.
if we can cure all our own stupid bias before trying to
change the world, soon the world would be in peace.

## game theory & behavioral economics

two things putting in a plate in front of you, you suppose that
they have some connection (if not belong to each other), right?
what if they dont?

like i was following game theory and behavioral economics
(in general, i'm saying about theoretical and empirical matters)
. they
are in the same master course, i didnt know that i assumed they
belong to each other.

but they dont =.=~

####what makes me personally think so?


my most recent thesis proposal is about crowdfunding.
i develop them as experiment to be run, and the thesis will be
about behavioral
regularity in the field.

but then i do a dreadful mistake. i solve it using game theory in
one morning after christmas. and it turns out to be an undergrad exercise.
and i cant even incorporate the empirical data in that exercise anymore.
it's disaster
because you dont present a pure undergrad exercise to your thesis committee.

it's not the idea that is unworthy, it's the way i approach it leading
to failure.

####what makes me objectively think so?

the unfortunate thing is not i got in game theory class first to
have that bias in my head, but because i didn't know that they dont
belong to each other. i see big names in both fields talking about
each other all the time.

but as i read behavioral papers about empirical data in the field,
(at least data in the field). i realise that, there is nothing wrong
with trying to describe the situation of something, as long as you get
good data on it. it's magnificient already if you can just
describe reality as it is. and
you dont need theoretical back up for that.
because data speaks for itself.

you dont need to crave for theoretical back up
just for the sake of publishing.
(of course you still have to do it if it's necessary).
because good data justify itself.

at this point, we need to separate good data & morphed data.
it's an ethical & qualified matter of the researcher.
if you have a sh*tty data even after sweatty polishing
& rigorous deleting, and
you are still so insecure that you
desparately crave for some theoretical back up & hope it gets published,
that's trivially trash.

but there are two different things.
and empirical work (as long as it has high quality) is not for the weak.
it actually takes just as much resource for empirical researchers
to produce something that has value.
plus you have to fight off the money, fame & political oriented fakers
in your field.

but we have that kind of losers in all fields.
it's something that everyone can fall for.
it's just that, some fields have the natural advantage of
easily spotting fakers.
if you do some sh*t
in theoretical area, you'll get your ass kicked very soon,
(Binmore is a salient name among asskickers, but there's actually
a long live tradition of honor behind him, so there is no
reason to tag his name with that).

but in empirical work, it's harder to distinguish.
it's like the lemon market of Akerlof, just because it's hard to
distinguish, in long term, people tend to have negative look on it.
and they equate.

## what should be

people put the criteria of being theoretise-able for empirical data
are actually theorists.
unfortunately, theorists got that power to put criteria
on other things, because they are respected scholars.
and unfortunately, empirical work doesnt get that
much honor already because there are real disasters among them.

but is it a bit unfair?

i read Rubinstein, i read Binmore, their writing is
undoubtly wonderfully elegant.
but genius people dont see their strength as strength,
they push the theoretical boundary very far, just because they can do it.

(like
[this mathemagician](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26753?cmpid=NLC%257CNSNS%257C2015-0108-GLOBAL#.VMnmIzXRKPR)
angers over his unread 500 page proof,
or
[this mathemagician](http://www.zalafilms.com/films/countingabout.html)
that is no one but proves one of the most
struggling problem in maths.)

we laypeople can only sit back & admire their work, if we can catch up
that far. we can only wonder:
how can they do that? how do they think when they think of
continuum best response? what is the meaning of strategy in the perfect
equilibrium that stand the pertubed fluctulant test? if neoclassical
only requires some technical rationality,
these subgame perfect strategies must be mega-rational.
and how can they even sleep at night?

but let's me tell you one thing.

even among the smartest brains of game theorists, they still cannot
agree collectively on the convention of how should students draw the game tree.
every game theorist writes his own book using
his own way of drawing a game.
one draws the tree down from the top because
that is the natural direction of human reading.
one draws the tree up from the ground saying
that a tree is supposed to follow sunshine &
gravity even if that is a tree is living in a
book because human's perception lives in earth gravity that's why.
one draws the tree from left to right because the convention of
reading from left to right is maybe due to the fact that most
people are right handed.

-> i eagearly look forward to the day when some arab game
theorist writes a book that draws a game tree
from right to left, arguing for the diversity of a tree in the ecosystem.



## in short
so, theoretical & empirical, both have its right & wrong.
and no one can take out the right to be wrong of others.

genius will continue to complain that people dont catch up,
but despite that sadness :D, they
eventually still get Nobel prizes for pushing the frontier
of human knowledge forward.

emprical works will continue to describe the situation of reality.
as long as they dont try to predict & try to stand among the work of
theoretical matters (or try to get in the political game), 
no one can deny their valid existence.
no one can require reality to have theoretical back up
in order to be recognised
because no
one have authority to question a robust reality.

(on the philosophy of science, i think
we have obsolete beliefs on how academics research should be.
some researches are not wrong, they are just based on obsolete beliefs.
a thing is right wrt two conditions. first, there is no other mutant genius
saying the opposite. second, the context doesnt change.
we can't predict the born of a new mutant genius but
the old static world that we dearly cherished
is now already changed into this fully networked, integrated
& dynamic world than ever before. we need to keep our heads up.)

some last words on data based fact:
it's really beauty enough to observe the statistically robust reality.
(it's a bit alienated if you happen to fall out of the crowd most of the
time though).
and all the empirical papers that understand their value,
as far as i see,
stay well inside the line.
