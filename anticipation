# utility, & utility of anticipation
*(not that anticipated utility from Loewenstein, the one from Nash)*

academia favors kids [with big RAM](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity?language=en#)
to comprehend densed symbolisation stuff
like maths.
happening to be a grad kid that stays on the other extreme of that scale
(2\*2\*2 = 6
is the kind of maths i do),
i have to *not·believe* in that.

the thing is, most respected scholars jump to maths too fast as a
way to shorthand all their thinking, just because they can.
but what helps me *not·believe* in that mathness is the fact that there
are genius who doesnt need the motto "if you do something complicated,
you put it in the paper".
and they dont try to put things simple just to avoid the awkwardness
of teaching a stubborn with mild·dyslexia kid, they do that because it's their
[principles to live by](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf).

anyway, i do see the mis·alignment between me & academia.
to the end of my master,
i find out that the things in class that significantly improve
my daily life are the things that are irrelevant to my academic grades
the most. (still dont feel bad about
[not passing & low grades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X0mgOOSpLU) though).

##what is utility?

utility, in utilitarian view, is the pleasant you gets when you consume
a good: eating a small orange for example. this makes me wonder about the social class of the person
who originates this idea.

anyway, Sen knows what's up. (maybe because he stands with the poor).
Sen says:
> utility is the degree of
satisfaction of usage you get from a good.

(Teacher says this is what the word litterally means in Latin languages,
it's the same in my language also).

so we need to decompose a good into a vector of its functioning.
the ability to use, combine the functions of other goods is called
*capability*.

>the second part of utility is emotional.


seeing utility this way makes it difficult to develop a mathematical
model, but it clarifies many concerns for me.
for example:
two people take surgery. one for her cancer (which is for survival),
the other for her plastic
breast (which is one of the most f*cked up practices of the 20th century).

another example can be two people buying stamps.
one to send letters. the other for his fetish.


- a funny story


i was in a small party day of Ruby girls on Rail in the park of Trento.
the organizers were giving the first contact to Ruby by aiding groups of girl
to make their own very first app. my group has girls from management class

by the way, MIM students are
amazing, i saw their presentations on real world business application,
they are doing real better than MEC students.
MEC students may be pissed off thinking they are doing
high·level stuff
but i'm ready to claim this claim. putting us all in the turbulent market,
i bet on MIM student survival. (phd doesnt count as real job,
my fellow friends ^^).


anyway, the girls were saying: maybe we do some apps for girls, because
today is the girl day. i was a bit disappointed because 5 minutes into the
work, and they already brought the gender onto the table. but then,
another girl (i dont know this girl), said:

\- let's do something functional.

 this would be the single reminder for the rest of my life.

## utility of anticipation

the pre·assumption of studying decision making across time frame is that
there is tomorrow.

why do someone give up their immediate gratification for future consumption?
they may say that they save for themselves. is it really the same person?

no.

is it the same as i'm giving up my immediate gratification for someone
very else?

yes.

why?

decomposing me & you get a set of functional skills & a set of knowledge.
these two sets define me of today. tomorrow the sets widen ->
tomorrow i·today cease to exit. hence, if im giving up my immediate
gratification today, i'm giving it up for someone else.

but do i get utility today if i give up my immediate gratification?
there must be something. there must be a portion of utility in giving.
it's the utility of anticipation.

and it's not that anticipated utility function of Loewenstein which is
a long line of mathematic symbols with discounting this & that.

i'm saying the anticipation definition from Nash:
if i think about tomorrow's consumption, i have an anticipation of
it.

take Nash's example:
>if i know that tomorrow i got a Caddilac, then we say i have a
Cadillac anticipation.

## how can i consume the utility of another living thing?

why do i care about a someone else at all? why do i give up my
immediate gratification to them (given that i *can afford* to give).

you talk to dolls in your childhood, dont you? you project your mental
reperesentation on them. hence i
[*mirror*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l80zgw07W4Y)
your consumption
in my *self* & i consume that *derivative feeling*.

it's called sympathy & we have a neural mechanism for that.
of course it's not genuine as our own utility feeling but
what i consume today (if i give up my immediate gratification) is
not the utility of the consumption itself but from the
the utility of the anticipation of it (i imagine it).
just like what you consume if you give is not the consumption itself
but it's the utility of the other's consumption.
for the story of consuming the other's consumption, i cite one such
story at the end of this post.

*(off·track bragging: hehe i was in a workshop listening to prof
Ferrari in Cimec some other day, i really didnt expect that,
i was like let's come with some ignorant curiousity)*



## a simple case of anticipation utility

Loewenstein calls this delay-speedup asymmetry situation:

- you will get a TV in 1 year, how much do you pay to have it today? 54$

- you get a TV today, how much do you need to be paid to delay it 1 year? 126$

why is it?

in the first case, what i consume today is a TV anticipation.
but i pay 54$ to get the TV today, so i got U(tv) - 54$. this must be
equivalent to the utility of the anticipation of a TV in 1 year.

> U(TV) - 54$ = utility of the TV anticipation [1]

in the second case, what i consume today is a real TV.
it's equivalent to: i get paid 126$ to delay the TV which means that
i give up my TV consumption, i get 126$ and a TV anticipation.

> \- U(TV) + 126 + a TV anticipation = U(TV) [2]

> 126 + a TV anticipation = 2*U(tv)


substitute [1] into [2] we get:

> 126 + [U(tv) - 54] = 2*U(tv)

> U(tv) = 126-54=72

the utility of the TV today is equivalent to 72$

-> no paradox.

-> life would be so much easier if economists take their subjects simple.

anyway, this is a very simple case. for other cases,
the anticipation function is impossible to estimate.
(is it a function at all?). in anticipating things, people
may concentrate on one thing so big, they ignore
the other smaller elephant in the list blah..

human behavior is complex anyway. it's also very much
upto the environment. the reason why economists keep finding 
new anomalies & new patterns (which are contrasting) in consumer behaviors
may come from the fact that the behavior is vast & very fragile.
we are the product of evolution of billions of year.
how can we not be magnificient ^^?

-> a *sophisticated* decision maker
must be the one that knows that they cannot predict their own preference.
and the *naive* decision maker is the one that thinks they can.

dealing with this, maybe the new method of statistics can help:
neural network learning
(deep learning). you feed it data, more data, big data, and it can estimate
the pattern for you (in anyway, that pattern can't be discounted
compound rate taking from the bank)

the thing is, this business is for the one who has comparative advantage
in resources (like money & a computer with big RAM). me no =.=

so i'd better concentrate to pass exam instead.


## a story of utility of anticipation

i present here the only gift·exchange game
i can recall of: the gift·exchange from
["The gift of the Magi"](http://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/1-the_gift_of_the_magi_0.pdf
)
, by O. Henry *not* et al. (1906)

That literature addresses quite delicate (& lovely) theoretical issues.
In the framing of Christmas, player A sells her hair to buy
player B's a clock chain. Player B, simultaneously, sells his
clock to buy player A a comb.

They self-interest in the anticipation of joy of the other.
Even if that anticipated joy turns out to be impossible,
at the end, what they enjoy even more is the reciprocal
(though failed) intentions (of love).

O. Henry published quite a lot on these kinds of fun,
short, spot-on social experiments :)
