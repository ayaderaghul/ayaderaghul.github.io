# the science of choice

topic: Evolution of behavior in the repeated bargaining game. A simulation.

keywords: bargaining game, evolutionary game theory, agent based model

this talk initiates from my master thesis so it is an amateur work.
different versions of it are presented at:

- workshop "the science of choice" - max planck institute, rostock Oct 15

- [meetings](https://sites.google.com/site/gametheorymeetings/home) of game theory application - lisbon Nov 15

- track on evolutionary game theory - new york Dec 15

this version is recorded at rostock, intended for outsiders.
the audience Q&A is cut off but it's very good questions coming from very young people.

i still take Q&A.

the code is available on my github.
here are videos of the talk and the automated slides:

a big thank to all the people that make this happen.
