# dream

Alice is a girl that is nice, careful and mature. Alice went in my room to ask me to help her putting eyedrops today. We laughed and cried with that task. Then i got diarhear.

*

I slip into my blanket, close my eyes, breath heavily and discretely speak short thoughts out loud to Alice sitting next to me.

She turns off the main lights, uses a very low tone of the yellow bed light, and arranges the bed to make sure im covered fully. I just lie there & let her do that, not moving a toes.

*

My room is small, the low tone of the light makes it smaller. I feel like the days in my house when the light went out, we'd light some candles and watched the reflecting shadows dancing on the walls. Sometimes we'd run out to see the moon incredibly bright, or stars that i've never seen that sparkles in big city anymore.. But sometimes we were just too bored hence we lied down around the candles..

Tonight is like that. I asked Alice abt her boyfriend, and while im breathing heavily & complain my 5 blankets are too thin, she starts to describe the love of her life. A very honest and good man, and beautiful guy.. He's from bangladesh and working 10h a day as a help-cook to support his family and relatives... They met very late at night and her family is quite open minded, they just say "ok you've been together for 1 year now, maybe you think about bringing him here once in a while.."

She went on & on about how clever and hard-working and determined he is, on how they think about the future, on how she'd try with all her exam and work to help him if she can..

Until I just fall asleep, i think she also talked about how little they could be together and how much they'd like that to be changed and how hopeful she's about their situation and how sure he is about that...

oh lovers' dream are so alike.

that final thought drifts me slowly into dormant state,
where awaits my dream
