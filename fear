# fear

*this'd be the longest post i've ever written, named "journey into the darkness"*
*because it's updated over time*

so i've been through shit recently.
all the magnificient problems i've been accumulating through my whole life
suddenly reaches its critical mass and blows up right into my face.
i've come to accept my problems and seek out treatment actively. it's time to
accept that i remember. because if i say i dont remember, wicked things just
pile up in my psyche and grow in all forms of fucked up.

it's not that i normally remember everything, but i think we all
have relational memory, things associate together like a network, and when this node is
fired up, the others around it also.. until the whole memory set lights up like a
firework... it's just for me the firework is a bit too burning.

the taxi driver in Drive says "you are only as healthy as you feel",
i agree with that,
and people that says "you cant says that you are this and that ..." my ass, you
judgmental little shit with insensitive skin, go away.

my general doctor says "you are too young to have depression" so i dont know what i have
but it punctuates by emotional bangs. it's figuratively a bang,
like you are feeling whole
then suddenly you see smt and the whole you implode. you feel that
you are falling apart and
cant breath and cant hold on to anything. your brain stops making top down interpretation,
you see the brick on the wall and try so much without knowing what does that mean a brick,
what does that mean all these tiny lumps on these surface, what does that mean all these
color... it doesnt make any sense, everything, and you process those nonsense
signals from your sensors while breathing
like crazy, like you are dying. and i think it's not grammatically wrong if i say that
im litterally dying, not figuratively.

and it's not that when you are depressed you eat junk food and engage in unhealthy
habits. you refuse to exist at all. it's like you are going to eat, but then what
does it mean eating, i dont understand that, it doesnt make anysense, and what does
it mean you getting up and moving your legs, what does that meann...
and you just lying on bed looking senselessly into the ceiling, for hours.
everytime you tends to get up, you only make a simulation of you getting up, walking
to bathroom, or doing smt... but you can run that simulation hours and hours without
being able to really execute it..
and you know you are dying, but you dont care anymore, you have that weak signal of
hunger inside your stomach but you dont care anymore, nothing matters, nothing.

and even when i finally pull myself together to get up and eat something, it doesnt work.
i dont remember since when i have to switch to soluble fibre diet but i cannot eat
anything but white rice. anything else i eat, i shit all over the place while feeling
like my abnomial twisting grumpily inside. and it's not any better because soluble fibre bores
the shit out of me also.

that is definitely not a way to live. compared to others around me, im already dead.

so i want to cure that sadness.

## medicine

i react w almost all medicine so far. the one that is expensive and is supposed to
help my digestion makes my intestine violently snap back.
then i switch to soluble fibre diet, boring, but at least soothing.

if you can sleep, do sleep it out, if you can still cry, do cry it out. if you cannot
eat virtually anything, try soluble fibre (cook the cheapest white rice w a peeled
carrot/zuchini or a hand of lentice into
porridge). insoluble fibre
cant solve in water & it'd iritate the shit out of your intestine. lentice is a grain
that is high in protein and insoluble fibre, so  why i put it in? because if you dont
eat enough nutrition, you'd die sooner than you thought. also, whole grain stuff stop
the hunger bang. the hunger bang is the state you feel after 3 hours
if you eat white rice only. that state is quite primal so when it's activated,
you cant concentrate on anything else, you cant live your life effectively.
when i feel ok, i start to put tuna, prawn.. my favorite
in the porridge. for the fruits, eat banana, kiwi, berry.. try to get rid of the peel
(insoluble fibre alert) or blend them together (heaven awaits), for example,
banana and pineapple (+ a twist of condensed milk - i cant drink diary product in general)
are star-crossed lovers. though fructose sugar is irritating, i do drink warm honey +
a few drops of lemon in the morning.
i have problem w small
orange and peach though they are loves of my life. anyway, it really depends on one's
own body so try one at a time to see.

## psychologists

i have ongoing treatments with psychologist(s).
after each session, i go home and have wildly loud dream, it's like all the darkness
in me are rallying together for a rage on me because i dare to bring them out into
daylight. but a few days after, these monsters and
exhausting memories loosen their grips a little bit. pyschologist says it takes time.



## meditation
###session 1
sounds pretentious enough, but if the sadness comes, try the strategy of
letting it sink in and feel it.
anytime i attempt hindering, it kicks back, so let's cooperate.
turn off the light, invite it in & let it
sit beside you. breath in oxygen, breath in life. let all the bad memory pop up,
like a gallery, walk across that gallery of yours, along the dark tunnel (i'd like
to imagine a dark tunnel as an interface to communicate w monsters,
because monsters like darkness, if you dont make a journey
into the darkness, they may not show up at all, and you are unable to negotiate w them).
maybe along the walk, narrate your life when it swiftingly flow in front of you,
all these embarrassing memory, all these stupid, ridiculous, lame, ... things you've
said and done... dont do anything, be a visitor, and narrate it as it goes in front of
you, like a librarian indexing sadness.

if somehow a good one comes up, light it up with silver lights, with rainbow..
i have something like that in my psyche, it's a smile, a hand, a shoulder, a glazing eye,
a voice, a laugh, a breathing.. it feels soothing like a foggy silver cloud rising up
from nowhere.. but it feels pleasant..

stay in that tunnel for as long as you feel like, after a while, you'd feel
your whole body radiating
in lights and healing fire.

do some massage for your whole body after you come back to reality, just massage
everywhere and particularly where you feel like.
or take a bath, for me, food and bath are like blessing. cooking is labourous but if
you can buy fresh ingredients, it's ALWAYS absolutely worthy. when i say i miss the sea
i mean i miss the seafood. and fruits also, and tons of other delicious things.
about bathing, it's not that i take a bath everyday, no, because i dont take a bath for
30 min, i take a bath for 2 hours straight. i cant imagine i take a bath less than that
time, because i'd like to take care of my hair, then let the shower really hot,
and use some lavendar gel, it feels like paradise. i cant do it any other ways
around, without lavendar or without massage or without face scrub or without hair
products.

after the first session (sit as long as you feel like, for me, the first time,
it's 30 min)
that night, the biggest monster comes, says hi by a direct hit. i have a massive
amount of emotions so i cry it out until i cannot breath i have to sit up and curl
toward my pillow so that i can have some oxygen while crying. one hour. primal fear.
desperation. i keep talking to myself and holing my hand, "it's ok, it's ok, cry it
out, no body can suffer this,..so it's ok to have a good cry"
that monster makes a brief visit of one hour,
leaves me exhausted, inside-out, flat and falling into sleep. emerging out of that
crying episode, i suddenly know what i want. what makes me resentful and irritating
and not enjoying life.
###session 2
so i decide to make another session of visiting that cave again. i consider that to be
a good step and expect there'd be more monster visits. i've never been in such a
wild primal fear emotional state before. and words that i utterly spit out in that
darkest moment, are from the deepest of my dark side. let's get in that cave again and
befriends those monsters, because they are a part of me, they live in me, they are me.

second session of the journey into the darkness: i close my eyes, try to tune down
other sensory signals, and the dark cave & tunnel wrap around me (i think for me
it's a dark tunnel because i enjoy the warmness of curling fully under a fluffy
blanket. some people can only sleep w their head outside but for me it's the contrary).
as soon as start to recognise the dark cave, the monsters start to come. i feel them
coming in my chest.
so this time they are a bit more cooperative. last time i have to search for them,
i have to find the cave, the interface that would let me communicate with them.
this time they arrive early, so i let them sit around me, one by one.
i feel them because when there is a memory popping up that push on my chest, i call
that a little monster. i let them arrange themselves as they please around me, while
i start to light up myself in silver and white and healing lights. i'd be the light
source in that cave. that light flowing through me, illuminating my skin is a
healing light, it brings courage and heal me. after i fire like a torch, the monsters
with different shapes and sizes have come very crowded. i asked "so what's the monster
that visit me last night?" "oh it was a lion" i touch it. then next to it, there is this
black furry giant that doesnt have any face, i hug it also, "maybe you are my fear"...
then next to it, there is this beast that have so much thorn, and it's like it's a
predatory wearing armors. i stand in front of it, look at it, "maybe you are the
sexual assaulter, let me touch you a little bit", but it grunts and i become scared,
so i stopped "we have time.." i say.. then next to it there is this little wicked
child with its thin and frail black spirit, its hair wrap to cover its face and it
has one glowing white eye (no iris), i actually have a sketch of this little monster,
it's my lamest days. i dont dare to touch it but i spend a little time looking into
its white eyes.
then i start to recognise other monsters..
some of them have the shape of human, they have the face of people i know, my relatives,
aunts, ... they dont say or do anything.. i hug them, when i think of the unpleasant
feeling i have with them, and i said "it just happens that my problems materialise
in the form of you, bc you have that problem, too".. so i hug them all, and
i know it's not personal.

i saw all people in my family, the whole family, with flickering memory of them,
some have very fond memory.. like my little sister.. or my grandmom.. so i travel
down that road w them, back to the cottage that i live with my grandmom when i was
small.. i get in that cottage again, touch the soil walls, touch the wooden window..
sit on the doorstep.. glowing, while watching my grandmom sweeping the yard, little me
sitting on the floor.. i see all the fond and bad memory.. i kiss them all.. all of
my little friends when we play in the garden, we make flowers and take fake picture..
there was only one picture man in the village and we pretend to be him, we take picture..
then there are so many tree in the garden, i remember every one of them, in each corner..
there is this jackfruit that get striked by a lightning and never grow back again..
there is this jackfruit tree that grandmom talk to it before she cut down its fruit..
i love jackfruit.. there is this cloudy tree that looks so elegant but it has so many
thorns that she plants it to be the dividing line with neightbour. there is this
little pond that doesnt have fish. then my grandmom points to the brightest star
on the sky and tells me the story of some old fisherman up there in the sky..
i've never imagine OH how can there be a man in the sky to catch the fish..
there are so many things..

after visiting that lane of memory, i come back to the tunnel, i sit down and wait
if more monsters would come.. though my tunnel is already very crowded...

and that's it..

that night i have a little crying but i can sleep. the sleep doesnt come back fully yet,
i wake up every 2-3 hours and finally wake up early.

so the third day, i do another session, i think about relationship in my life,
i think about relationship of people, i think about how and why, i see some pattern but
i'd rather keep it redacted from here. whenever i say smt related to people, i feel like
i should keep them in, because they dont like me telling the truth. i do think about
the relationship in my house, between parents and relatives. between husbands and wifes
in my extended family. it helps to explain so much all the insecurity and fear that
i bring around. they share that traits and i inherit those.

today i have the visit sooner than i thought, right in the nap after lunch. i have a
very real and loud dream about family (i always have loud dreams about my family,
somehow we're always quarrelling and saying ridiculous things to each other).
then when i wake up, exhausted and sad, another massive wave of sadness hits me.
so this is it. this is that fear again. welcome back. between crying my heart out,
i take a break to breath in and to encourage myself "this is ok, you've search for
this for 24 years, you avoid this fear for 24 years, it has to feel intense,
it's ok, cry it out..." i dont know how long it last, when i finally can wake,
(or the tears has drained?), it's already late in the afternoon. it's time to do some
physical exercise.

###session 3

the third day, i had to go to the bank (out in the morning) and i feel an urge to cry very
soon in the early morning, so i try to negotiate with the wicked little kid,
"i promise i'd wait for you at noon, please come back at that time, i need to do this
first.." then i try to go out and see magnificient and wonderful tree in the winter
light, it's so happy and so fruitful what mother nature shows me, so i get lightened up
a bit.

but as i was out side, the feeling on my chest gets intense. and as i try to shake it
off by promising i'd get back to that, it lingers. and then i feel iritated by
irrelevant people, by people that i project my frustration on, people that i THINK i hate
for justified reason.. sure i dont care about them (some of them are lame enough to be
under my threshold so i can cut them off) but i dont know why i keep hating them.

then suddenly i know why as the feeling to cry comes back growing bigger. that's all
about that affection-starved little kid, that frail figure with one-white eye and messy
hairs with a worn-out bow on her head. she has lived alone in the dark for too long
(24 years), she has that telepathic power of enacting massive amount of crying urge on me.
not because she is malevolent or malice, it's because she needs attention, she needs tender
love and gentle cuddle.. but 24 years of being neglected, she grows wild. everytime she
whines "i need my daddy" in the dark corner of my soul, i'd violently crying wild on
the surface.. she is me. i've always been fascinated by clothes of little kids, maybe
it's because i have this inner child in me that forever get trapped and abandoned.

and everytime i try to superficially suppress her on the surface, she sents her angels.
all these big giant monsters that i've identified in that dark cave: fears, inferior,
anger, hatred, resentment... are her agents. she sent those agents to manipulate and nag me. because
she is desperate, her message is full of tear and frustration and sadness..

so, though i was biking in public, i decide i dont resist her anymore. resistance is futile.
and i've being a resentful bitch to people (though i dont want that) just because i want
my daddy. so i cry, not too loud but i let the kid show up in broad daylight. i tell her
"im sorry, i've never been shown how to love someone i care about, so i reject you,
and i cut you off, and i dont care.. and im sorry. for 24 years, you've lived in the dark.
that must be lonely. not anymore, from now on, you go out with me, you come anytime
you want, we deal with this together, people abandon me, doesnt mean that i can hurt you
and leave you.." and i start to call her Megan, i let her sit behind me on the bike,
sing her a sad song, and we go to shopping together. we do think together.

at noon, she starts to whine "i want my daddy", i said, "i want daddy too, but we'd have
to have lunch first, then we'd talk about this, ok.." .. i have another massive attack of
crying that afternoon. one hour. when i rose, it feels so empty and blank.

at night, the crying comes again, and i feel so tired, i cant breath, i dont remember
what i utterly speak out at that crying session anymore. i love that person too much.

###session 4
today im ok until late afternoon, i start to wonder why migan dont start to cry yet.
but then it comes. so i meditate but it get disturbed, i actually sit for 40 min
hallucinating a cozy cave with a medium fire burning, and my lover comes to me,
i'd talk to him very gentle and cuddle w him, i make him tell me everything i'd like
so much to hear.. but then i say you arent real, let's me keep this smiling eyes for me,
because it is for me.. i love everything about him but i love his eyes the most,
especially when it's glazingly starry and it shows happiness and it shows that he loves me.
i love that so much, so i say let's me keep this for only me.. and i open my eyes.

it doestn sound like a meditation session so i know im going to cry soon. i lie down
and said "migan, i need to get up and do karate and study, so let's do this cry session
now, my eyes hurts because i cried too much yesterday, my nose swells, my throat dries
in pain.. but let's do this, as long as we need to do this.." so i start to cry,
i dont bother to describe anymore, it hurts too much because all the muscles have
been tiring for crying too much this week. it hurts my head. this happen for another hour.

then i get up and do karate. but somehow i cant shake off the deadly feeling to
focus on doing karate. i start to feel anger and disgust. after a while, i try to ask,
migan, what's are you trying to say by sending this anger and disgust, because it's very
unpleasant and it sucks the life out of me.. if im in public, i'd have projected it
on people.. migan doesnt answer. she never answers. so i keep going tiredly.

my muscle hurts but everyday it does the move a bit better, which means that the muscle
are builidng up, which means that it's a mechanism that can be said that it remembers.
it's muscle memory. everyday it's different from yesterday. i mean not figuratively
but litterally. because it works that way for neuron too, the synaptic just collect
chemistry mark and if it cross a threshold, you remember.. of course every little
memory competes to be remmebred, that's why you have to intentionally train and choose
what to remmeber, otherwise, it forms w emotions and you only remember the worst memory
because it burns the hardest.

then i got this realisation. this time it's not that monster (uh no that migan kid) anymore.
(i start to not call migan by the word monsters...maybe all the bad guy in this world
gets his bad name all because of that, because pepole dont understand so they dont tolerate,
they tolerate their kids' crime but not a stranger's).anyway, it's not migan.
so different monsters have shown up! maybe tomorrow i'd try to figure out and talk to
them in the cave, they are guilt and insecurity, and debt.

i feel relief, i thought it's migan, i was wondering why i keep blaming the one i love,
why, then i realise it's not him.
it's just some small debt that i created
when i took the birth control pill and gone wild with everyone, then it's a lame debt
that i can totally pay. anyway, it's a real relief when you start to be able to name
your trouble. half way of problem solving is trouble shooting...

anyway, it's really dangerous if you just fixate on the person you really love
and blame them for everything, assume them to be responsible for your happiness,
that's the fastest way to push them away..


## psychologists
after a while, it gets worse and worse about the daddy issue thing and because the person
that i identify with doesnt show understanding and help, i have another breakdown.
then it's exam session so i work like crazy, overnight. i never imagine i can work at night.
after  a few days of high pressure working, when i was sleeping around the day (i dont
have enough resting sleep). i suddenly felt this startle in my heart, it hurts in the chest
and i wake up, heavy breathing. because i start to comfortable talk to myself a lot
recently, i mumble "i want to be alive.." "this is dead" "twenty four and doing this is
suicide" "i want to be alive"... so i change.

i dye my hair blue, make it curl, watch tons of awesome youtubers (females.. advice on
living awesome...). i say what i want, be open and when i get rejected, i went through
another session of emotional breakdown... me and migan, i call her little chi sometimes..

my behavior changes. i care less about people. i feel more entitled to things. i feel
rebel. i talked back to psychologists.. i stand for my feeling. i confront my advisor
and say "this has to end" "why i have to suffer all of this" "i dont come here so that
you can start to say all of that" that's a big change because i feel courage. i dont let
anyone hurt me anymore. i feel like a rebelling teenager who doesnt want any one telling
her what to do.

after i went to psychologist and take the drawing test. i realise that the day i died,
maybe migan is me now, migan has grown into this 14 years old teenager, or this is another
personality that wakes up in the threat of me sacrificing myself to death.

i dont know.

but here are the pictures:
- a girl, migan, 14, getting better, but doing nothing
- a male: a general boy, tom, 7, having fun, kdis are ok. bc i naver draw a boy before.
i dont have a male figure in my life.
- a family: suddenly i cry, i draw the pic that my sister draw when she was little,
she draw 4 suns and star around, i asked her what is that, she said family. so that's
the ideal of family in me.
- a house: i dont know how, i hesitate.. it's like i dont have the mental representation
of a home. but i draw it anyway, i little house like kid house, w bike, balls, kites, tree
flowwers...pointy leaves (aggressive behavior)
- a tree: big tree, some leaves, big leaf buble, roots, to the left
- a second tree, to the right, curl root, curl branches, half right has leaves, details
leaves, pointy leaves, an apple (need to have nurturing), stars, fish-shaped leaves..
shading (insecure)... the right part of the tree doesnt have any details.

then i talk about what do i think these things say about me, i say it reflects smt maybe
inside me.

then icomplain i dont like the idea of being controled and manipulated and dont want
to be pushed around by advisor... i want to move on...

i think the person i am now is either migan growing up or some oter personality.

so i have 3 personalities so far, a little kid, a dont-care teenager, a grown up woman.
the kid wants father, the teenager wants to move on and rebel, the woman wants a partner..
(yesterday i have this weird feeling of having ... mentally connected to the partner..
very spiritual but very real, and sweet, and i lke that.. i'd like him to give us a chance
for all these scenes in our head to happen)

### kei she comes and goes

entering my pms time, i seems to become another person, but i'd say that in my
subsconscious, a personality was able to form itself and shows up at favorable condition
(of lowering level of controling hormone). so i went into the cave, ask her what her name
is, what she would like to identify herself. i call her kay, or kei.

kei is a rebellious teenager at 14. she wants blue hair. so i suffer incredible long
(5 hours) of sitting down to dye my hair blue. she wants curl. so i spend incredible
long time to learn to curl. i cant resist the urge to curl.

kei doesnt care. so i blurt out everything. about "why i have to suffer this?"
(ie why are you so not nurturing and caring about me)

it's actually a good thing. she mess everything up. so we have to deal with the problem.
and everybody is mad about the mess but the mess is actually always there and growing up,
kei shows up and pull it out from under the rug and force everybody to solve it.

she gave me courage.

after that short period of visiting, i got sudden early period,
when i was sitting in the toilet, i feel this calmness in my soul and i was like,
oh kei has gone. she has gone silent. now i have to deal w all this problem with
calmed courage and lovely grace. :)




## karate
i turn to karate like a savior. the days that i was so sad and cant eat cant sleep,
i exercise the life out of me, so that i'd become so tired, i start to drink water in,
take food in, and the fatigue makes the sleep easier.
and it's true. because you learn to breath. the key to any meditation and yoga or
martial art technique is breathing. if you can learn to breath, you can do anything.
emerging out of
a karate + yoga session, i feel broken to the bone, breathing like crazy,
but extremely alive.
and it does help, because im unhealthy and weak, so even a marginal increasing in
physical strength and skill helps make my whole life and perspective better.
