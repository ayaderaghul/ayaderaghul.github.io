# the veil of ignorance for a reality check

*(this is intended to be a funny post)*

## blaming
this afternoon, i engaged in a very active session of blaming &
hating with a person that i know crystal clear that i will never ever
do a single thing with the most. it's so magnificient how
hating a shared person can bring two oh·so different persons so close.
i know for sure that i will never ever in my whole life do a
single *discussion* session with that particular guy.
but at that moment, i think we deserve each other.

it is very tempting to blame anything but you.
i really enjoy the blaming process in which
i carefully craft details to convince myself & the listeners.
but in this same afternoon, i also realise that,
as lovely as it sounds, that psychological shame-reliever
is a dangerous defense mechanism.

for example:
>i dont get good grade, this school doesnt deserve me.

>i am mistreated in hospital, this system is disastrous.

>i cant get job, this government is hypocritical.

>i dont have recognition, this academia is broken.

apart of the psychological utility it brings, blaming doesnt solve any other problem.
if i dont engage in such an active blaming sitting :D ,
i really dont have this epiphany =)).
hence, as far as i'm a typical ordinary human,
i **recommend everyone do that** at some point in your life.
but remember its insignificant function to your progress, and you would be fine.

##how much is enough
then come the second thing, we never know how much is enough.

in vietnamese literature of the old time, there is this story (which is just a documentary of the truth, people in that story are real).
a *vagabond* - an uneducated, homeless lumpen - living on the side of the society.
this guy is a drinker. he doesnt have money. but he make money to drink this way.
he uses broken glass to carve on his face, & with the bleeding face,
he come to other peasants' cottage in the village to scare them.
they give him money so that he leaves them alone.
their life is miserable enough, no need to get in trouble with a walking disaster.

everyday, his chore is to go through the village small road, drunken as hell,
then he starts to swear & curse every one.
he curses the mother who left him as an infant in the middle of nowhere.
he curse the society that doesnt let him live decently.
he curse litterally everyone.

everyone in the village hear him cursing, loud & clear.
but nobody does anything. nobody replies.
everyone just thinks that, that bastard's cursing must exclude me.

here we are!! everyone thinks 'it excludes me', 'it must not be me',
'why me', 'what have i done'..

-> we never know if we are in the bias.
the danger of bias's shadow is that there is no way to know whether
it's looming above you.
because it looms gradually with your help to distort the
reality in the way that delight you.

##a reality check
an imperfect solution to this is a reality check.
i believe in the strategy
"always be a skeptics to this reality".
for me, forgeting something that happened is completely normal
but remember something that did not happen,
it's quite problematic because i still intend to navigate through
the rest of this life as a decent human.


-> the first reason for the reality check: if i can trace back to
the begining of the logic without reaching a fallacy in the chain, i know it's the truth.

-> the second reason is also wonderful:
if it's not real yet, and i get to the truth without fallacy,
it means that i discover that truth :D

-> the third reason:
 if no one understands me, it's me that is in trouble.
because the chance of me being Tesla is very tiny
we dont even need to mention this.

here is the reality check i elaborate on the principle from John Rawl:
putting you under the *veil of ignorance*, how competent are you?

being under a veil of ignorance is like all people in this society wearing a same
anonymous mask. you dont know who is who. that's why you treat everyone the same.
you dont favor your kids, you dont disgust faces, you can only distinguish idea.

-> hence, a reality checklist:
cut off the superb advisor you conveniently mention, throw out that bigname mentor
you humbly praise,
cover the magnificient teacher you sometimes take a stroll with,
rip apart the kickass partner you have in selfie series on facebook,
who are you? and what do you do?

in specific, what is your functional skill list?
how big is the set of knowledge that you've built after all those years?

more details:
- this is computer era,
how many programming languages do you speak (at least the mainstream ones?)

*(recommendation: start with Julia if you have dating history with C,
or go old·school to take Scheme like me, or you can always go bold: take any in the
Lisp family,
Haskell for example)*

- this is a networked era,
how many human languages do you speak (apart from the one of british empire?)

- how many keywords of topics that you feel comfortable explaining it to people?
of those topics, how far can you really go in talking in depth about it with
a qualified person in the field?

- what vision that burn your thought, burn your sleep & wake you up in
the middle of an episode of your dream urging you to write it down,
so it will let you sleep?

well, in case you get a bit too much obssesive about things, take this trick:
- talk to that daunting obsession, out loud:

ok, i give up, i'm a frequent OCD user
but this time let me give up,
\**two hands on air*\*
go haunting someone else, haunt the guy next door
\**point to the wall*\*,
come back here after this date
\**show the calendar*\*,
visit me next time,
while i'm not busy among exams
\**show the slides*\*,
& hospital stuff
\**wave the bill with a little upset*\*,
and i promise i give you all the neurons i have to
[figure it out with you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDnOSk_ea6c)
\**go to sleep*\*
