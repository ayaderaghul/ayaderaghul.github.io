<p>These days it's fashionable to say that academia is broken.
Big system always has cracks &amp; academia is old enough to be called problematic
than just having a crack. Especially for people who stand in a faster time stream,
like technology for example. But there is one thing about this old-aged academia
that i like: in science, things never get personal.</p>

<p>Noobs (like me) may have to learn to appreciate this, but crossing a very low threshold,
and you are there. Depend on random factors
like your mood, when you enter grad school,
if you read a paper in good mood, you feel so into that
school of thought &amp; you move in that camp. then,
seeing so many respected scholars who are already there, you discard other camps.
But the thing is, the more paper i read in
good mood the more i see that lower bound for the existence of a camp is very low:
actually no camp has justified reason to be killed off.</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-about-good-mood-first" class="anchor" href="#about-good-mood-first" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>about good mood first,</h3>

<p>you may say that good mood is expensive. it's true. if i have unlimited resources i'd
be agreeable to everything. but i dont. and i hate reading.
listening to lecture is more appealing than reading. making sense from
symbols is so costly. why reading when i can just drag my corpse to
class listening to teachers &amp; somehow my brain will figure things out for me next
morning.
but that turns out to be the only artifact of me.
now i have to
trick me through the initial phase of dissonance when reading.
before this realisation,
i always find myself disregarding stuff authors write with some reason
i made up in hatred. only in the time of discipline (fueled by deadline-induced
energy),
i realise that starting to read (any paper!)
in a good mood make significant increase in absorbing what author says.</p>

<p>but you dont get good mood &amp; sharp mind for free.
if you use caffeine, i suggest jumping rope instead.
with faster blood circulating, every sense is magically strengthened
(and sleep to reset). and you are ready for another shift of working.
just like caffeine, after a while, you need to increase the dose of jumping rope
to feel the same marginal boosting &amp; sharpening your focus. but it's much better.</p>

<p>also, in the tough time, i realise the treasure of positive energy. you should
train yourself to mourn over a tiny fraction of your working memory lost over
switching to facebook &amp; switch back to work. it consumes more RAM just by multitasking.
it's the transaction cost because your working memory has to be wipen out before putting
new
dishes on it. cut that transaction cost off by doing things in streak,
not switching back &amp; forth.</p>

<p>the funny thing is that
discipline makes you predictable, like a freak calculating
the number of times to chew before swallowing.
but you'll only appreciate that when you see the cost of recalculating
stuff that can be set fixed &amp; let run automatic time from time.
i was practically eating nothing throughout
the day until i got in hospital. now i'm the only person commuting 20' to mensa to
eat. usually at an exact time both lunch and dinner, same for the bus.</p>

<p>normally, when you have all the time in the world,
things never get intense. but if you condense a whole semester reading material in
2 weeks, with the huge amount of positive energy you produce, you will generate
an equivalent amount of negative energy also. i think it should be true
to everyone. if you treat away the low in the emotional swing, the high point
of that cycle
vanishes. the reason i'm willing to endure the fluctuation of my mind is that i see the
pattern of me writing unstoppable in some day and being very dumb the other day
(even with hormones regulated ^^). so it seems like if you read me,
you'll catch feminine running
through the line. i'm not always like that. but expect it.</p>

<p>so what to do with negative energy? Loewenstein says
the scarry feature of visceral factors
(like depression, hunger, addiction.. in general an automatic program that will
be activated...) is that everyone underestimates the magnitude of their
effect except the one who is really in that condition. if you went through addiction
craving once, you forget the feeling after that (you may describe it but you cannot
re-experience). you'll always underestimate its effect in any planning.
you can never predict the lowest point of a stressful process can be <em>that</em> low, really.
the only way to prepare is to gradually develop a resilience, and find
a functional individual you can turn to in hopelessness.
i cope with that by diverting these negative stuff to
my boyfriend =)) (that's what i mean when i advise to get a partner that is functional).
just because he can take that. he really can fix &amp; endure
because he starts the process of
developing resilience before me. in a society,
the one who can bear the risk at lower cost is the one who should
take it, right?</p>

<p>last thing about discipline, discipline costs introvert social energy, too.
if i anticipate a social interaction, i have to think about it before, think about it
in the process, and think about it after. so i refrain from any social interaction
in the time that energy is so valuable.</p>

<p>anyway, here is the lower bound of reading topics for grad students: everything that get
to you is something that already make minimal sense requirement.
train yourself to that
will raise the overall level of wisdom, the common sense. it's in the process of
reading more that i witness personal details fading away.
author jokes this and that in their paper, say things
that i think are already obsolete here and there, or sometimes write confused stuff
that leave me wondering about the words more than focusing on the main problem..
but it evokes &amp; build up much less pre-judge. and less pre-judge is always better.</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-back-to-the-one-thing-i-like-about-academia" class="anchor" href="#back-to-the-one-thing-i-like-about-academia" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>back to the one thing i like about academia</h3>

<p>you may say that academia is personal, there is fame tagged to names.
but these names are not really brands. if you really want to define the word brand,
think about the consumerism. compared to that, the <em>brand</em> in academia is quite lame.
Nash is a hypothetical figure that i may say i am a fan. but if prof
Nash ever materalises, i can only hope i have some intellectually smart things to say.
otherwise, it should be an academic conference so i can listen to academic stuff.</p>

<p>argument in science never becomes flamewar. Never. It's like there is collective
stigma for it so it goes out very fast if not right away. you may say that it's
because a paper is formal. but writing a paper is only rigidly formal when noobs
like us writing papers in the scare
of saying something stupid &amp; pissing off seniors. among seniors, there is not that
pressure. higher hierarchical persons feel at ease at their position, there is no
reason to prevent them from showing a bit of their style in exhibiting opinion.</p>

<p>even with that, if an academic person says there is a hot debate on this topic recently,
the best drama i can imagine is some two individuals rigorously write paper in one year
and wait for reply in another year while doing another thousand things in their own
life. even for that, it's still very rare. I know only two. Or maybe adults
deliberately censor such stories out of grad kids' fresh world.</p>

<p>the first one is kinda from one side only. because you dont do frontal attack to well
established game-theory by pointing out the wrong of mega-rationality
when you dont fully grasp the ground yet.
The reason why prospect theory do the
same to neoclassical &amp; succeed has a lot to do with situational details.
Neoclassical was also
very maths and notorious at its time, but that time was centuries ago. everyone wants
to move on. on the other hand, game theory is on its high, there are still so much
to see &amp; it is still backed by so many giants. the mistakes it produces are still
deluxe mistakes. But i cant say that about future. game theory has problem. many people
are bootstraping it with ad hoc econometrics. but fixing a machine with duct tape
is desperate patching. if game theory cannot even cure itself, maybe one day it'll
fall just like the way the big old conservative neoclassical self-implodes.</p>

<p>the second 'hot' conversation is about fixed point &amp; the attempt to discredit it
out of economics because fixpoint theorem is too maths &amp; too off track for human's
modeling. But the funny thing is that they explicitly mention they're pissed off
then draw a crystal clear line for readers to not to be distracted out of the main
matter. and that's it. It flames out as never happened before in just 1 or 2
follow-up commentary.</p>

<p>Even when economist talks about hot emotions deliberately, they still narrate
with stone cold calmness. the chill feeling of a cool climate makes me feel
like there is a code of honor embeded somewhere among the bricks, kids dont see
it yet they inhale it gradually in every moving.</p>

<p>Corollary: people who still exhibit this trait are somewhat noobs.</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-what-makes-that-one-thing" class="anchor" href="#what-makes-that-one-thing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>what makes that one thing?</h3>

<p>Maybe the mechanism that helps maintain that ideology is the artifact of the system
of submitting a paper. A paper is a final product that is the only way to communicate
effectively with the world. there are so much distance. that distance makes you
professional, and cold. but the fact that that way creates that style
doesnt mean that that style
(after being created) can only be preserved by insisting going that way. that way
only shows that that style is possible.</p>

<a id="user-content-what-i-would-like-to-add" class="anchor" href="#what-i-would-like-to-add" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>what i would like to add</h3>

<p>I'd very love to see respected scholar blogging, they can still keep that stone cold
narration if they insist. But it'd be so much more efficient
for their knowledge to start to crack up &amp; spill over. they can reach
students &amp; other
stakeholders so much faster.
however i understand if they prefer to work hard to package a book to
get solid credit for that than to blog like a hobby. But i wouldnt bet on
things keep going this old way because nothing actually changes.
they can still write their book,
blogging will not interfere, it even enhances writing.
the monoculture
of microsoft (in 90s?) is just an artifact of the situation. no one dies with
open source. indeed everything flourishes.</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-why-that-one-thing-is-actually-a-great-thing-about-academia" class="anchor" href="#why-that-one-thing-is-actually-a-great-thing-about-academia" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>why that one thing is actually a great thing about academia</h3>

<p>The finding about the immunity to personal self in academia relieves me a lot.</p>

<p>If everyone get fanatic about their schools of thought, science debates would
become religion. But no. In science, when i speak about something, even my own
thesis, if  others throw bricks at it, i dont even matter. Because i dont have to.
if they have a refutation, it'd be brilliant.
the refuting loop only brings out the truth for everyone. And if someone throws brick
at the school of thought i follow, they should throw refutation bricks then,
otherwise i dont even need
to care. I doubt if any one else cares either. There is nothing ever personal about it.</p>

<p>The psychological distance created by separting a hypothetical identity to personal
stuff protects the author from the creative process (somewhere in
<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius?language=en">a TED talk</a>).
it makes people who kill themselves
for academic reason become nonsense, hence it stop others from thinking about that.
the lowest point in creative process can be devastating &amp;
suicidal but if you know that it's never something about you personally,
you hang on. and the best way to deal with turbulence is simple as that, hanging on.</p>

<p>When i collect jokes about academia (because it's so funny, and the ridiculously
funniest is the truest &amp; realest), i never feel i laugh about a particular person.
I'd go to tell my friend about that joke, and describe it's like a problem with
academia, not the persons who desperately want to publish.</p>

<p>you may say public shaming is about identity. i will argue that
of course it is. you do wrong things in any field, and you get punish. but you
keep a good deed and academia will be very
tolerant. if kids make mistake because kids are stupid,
adults dont punish them like
they mean to destroy them. if respected scholars make mistake because they are
human, peers dont really take the matter personally.</p>

<p>but trolls start to rise? then troll attitudes deserve to be cut off.</p>

<p>And that's good. I advocate that. The no identity of academia.
and the cool benevolent climate blooming with it.</p>

<a id="user-content-what-to-do-with-the-downside-it-also-brings" class="anchor" href="#what-to-do-with-the-downside-it-also-brings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>what to do with the downside it also brings</h3>

<p>now if you put in perspective with the turbulent market and business suits,
academia clearly is relatively slow, ease and highly collaborative, and tolerant.
but if everyone who dont get a job in recession
go to grad school, it sounds like we are too relax so we
end up with favorable environment
attracting even people that shouldnt be.</p>

<p>I take this idea somewhere in this blog
(<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">the blog that every nerds should read</a>):
even that,
it may sound like the best condition. in creative thinking, even good people
have possibility of diving from the blue sky down to the trash.
If we cut off the threshold of
low performance
too fast, we risk losing good people that can bounce back high.</p>

<p>Second, i got this from an interview i dont understand much from the lisp's father.
People ask what features others put in lisp that he doesnt like. He says there are
things that are not coherent with lisp's spirit, but he never minds because anyone
can always choose not to use it. That's it. There are stuff in academia that shouldnt
be, but one can always choose not to use that.</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-back-to-what-you-should-do-with-your-own-affection" class="anchor" href="#back-to-what-you-should-do-with-your-own-affection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>(back to what you should do with your own affection)</h3>

<p>that is the filter that you can keep control.
because at some point of development,
you have to trade off building up general wisdom (take
any topics coming to you) to nuture your natural drive (do what delight you).
Choosing something you like
is like setting up a self fulfilling prophecy looping over you for longer than you
can constantly consciously remind you of.
because you forget about that background program, you will get spiral up in one
direction that would turn out to be too much wasteful if you eventually (if at all)
realise
that you dont want it.</p>

<p>Which means: be careful what you choose and who you pick.
it's you who set the upper bound for yourself.</p>

<p>this is tricky though, because you never know the level you are in.
like writing. i never know my level of writing. but i start to get the sense of
other's writing. Writing
of psychologists is very loosely &amp; confusing. A philosopher writing is very long &amp;
discourage people to read on. With their good idea, if they take strict language
like maths, programming
or game theory more serious, their book will be surprisingly shorter, &amp; less
enduring. I never finish Sen's paper, never start Rawls (unfortunately i have to
get to his amazing idea through game theorists), i try half Schelling (he talk about
strategic though), and may till the end of life never touch Hume or Kant though i have
their books as some reminding token of what classics i'm missing.</p>

<p>that's why you should carry effort on being picky. being picky is socially costly.
but forming a connected network
creates synergy that you cannot think of. and when stroke hits you, the force
dissolves on a larger scale &amp; the whole network persists.</p>

<p>i end up with another off topic recommendation,
i suggest every grad kid starting a blog. (as many others already). if you
whine about being typical grad student on facebook everyday anyway, why not make
whining to new level. plus, keep quoting others doesnt lead you anywhere
close to be better.</p>

<p>and that's the real hopelessness.</p>
